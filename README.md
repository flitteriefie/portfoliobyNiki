Collection of smaller Python projects for practice.

Data Science 101 Projects:

How long it takes to buy an iPhone?
In order to determine an indication of living standards across Europe I have calculated how long it would take for someone earning an average net wage to buy an iPhone 11 256Gb model. Visualization can be seen in [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/profile/nikoletta.szab.#!/vizhome/JusttheiPhonePricesforEurope/DataforEU) 

[Consumer Complaints](https://github.com/flitteriefie/portfoliobyNiki/blob/master/Consumer%20Complaints.ipynb):
Using data from data.gov I have [cleaned the data](https://github.com/flitteriefie/portfoliobyNiki/blob/master/filnan.ipynb) created a machine learning algorithm to determine the company response for a financial complaint.

[Drug Overdose Clustering](https://github.com/flitteriefie/portfoliobyNiki/blob/master/ML.ipynb):
Using data from the data.gov website, and after [cleaning it](https://github.com/flitteriefie/portfoliobyNiki/blob/master/exploratory.ipynb),  I have used a hierarchical clustering algorithm to examine data of drug overdose cases from across the U.S.

[Happy LinReg](https://www.kaggle.com/nikolettaszab/happiness-regression): 
Simple multiple linear regression predicting a nation's happiness level based on multiple factors, including GDP.

[Weather LinReg](https://www.kaggle.com/nikolettaszab/second-world-war-weather-temperature-linreg):
Extremely simple linear regression model predicting maximum temperature based in minimum temperature.
